## ⚠️ Project Disclaimer (Read First)

**Technical Note**

This repository was developed during a period where my primary focus was shifting toward **Mobile App Development**. As a result:

- The codebase contains **legacy practices**
- Some architectural patterns may appear **messy or inconsistent**
- Clean code principles were occasionally deprioritized in favor of **rapid feature implementation**

This project has been intentionally preserved in its **original state** as a **developer log**, representing:
- My learning journey
- The logic-building phase of my career
- Real-world experimentation and growth

> ⚠️ This repository does **not** represent my current standard for production-grade, maintainable, or scalable code.
